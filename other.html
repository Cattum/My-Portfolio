            <h3>"Life"</h3>
            <p>The game takes place in a future society where humanity is confined by environmental collapse, living in a limited world. Players assume the role of a novelist who regularly visits a tavern called ‘Life’, run by a proprietor who serves unique wines, each containing the life essence and story of an individual. When a player selects a wine, they are immersed in the person’s narrative and engage in philosophical discourse reflecting on the journey.</p>
            <p>The stories are inspired by real human experiences, with initial narratives featuring a middle school teacher and a terminally ill cancer patient. Players can contribute their own life stories through a dedicated website, which will be incorporated into future game content.</p>
            <p>The game’s purpose is to mirror the player’s own experiences, leading to self-realization and awareness. It also includes a “Tree Hole Corner,” where players can write down their life experiences, with some stories being selected for interview and integration into new chapters. Players can also leave messages for NPCs or speculate on the future of characters, with responses from NPCs appearing in the game later.</p>

            <h3>Our Brave World</h3>
            <p>This innovative board game blends Call of Cthulhu's role-playing with the societal exploration of 'Brave New World' (Huxley, 2010). Players become leaders of an “utopia” navigating human dilemmas and shaping a ideal country through decisions affecting collective ideology, education, and politics. Interaction with complex NPCs’ challenges personal values and prompts reflection on such as theoretical vs. applied sciences and social structures.</p>
            <p>Featuring a sandbox design, the game emphasizes narrative autonomy and supports players creating content, reflecting a collective vision for society’s future. It’s more than entertainment; it's a platform for global discourse, encouraging players to contribute and deliberate on the advancement of society while reflecting on the outcomes of their own societal construct in the game's evolving landscape. This dynamic board game aims to illuminate contemporary issues, engage with diverse perspectives, and inspire an ideal world.</p>

            <h3>Modern Renaissance</h3>
            <p>This research aims to advocate for an ideological renaissance, encouraging individuals to detach from the fast-paced nature of modern life and re-evaluate their purpose. By doing so, it argues that people can make a greater contribution to society. The project explores the historical development of humanism and the Renaissance, showing how we are at a similar point in history, where an ideological revolution is needed to enhance collective human consciousness and address the shortcomings of current societal systems.</p>
            <p>The research will also analyze Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, examining the negative impact of contemporary entertainment on education, politics, and social consciousness. It warns that without improving collective consciousness, society will stagnate, leading to a loss of self-awareness and the failure to maximize individual potential.</p>
            <p>It will further investigate the role of digital media in spreading ideas, drawing parallels between Renaissance media like paintings and literature and today's digital platforms. It will explore how digital media influences the subconscious mind, demonstrating its potential to play a key role in the ideological revolution.</p>
